Dearﬁm,

Your note expressing sympathy on behalf of my colleagues and fnends at
CTR was on my desk when l returned from Bataan. Thank you. 1 had hoped
to ﬂy back from Bristol to New York to catch at least part of the meeting.
In the event, the local situation proved to be overwhelmmg; my mother of
nitety three needed a lot of help. l am sorry to have let you down but at
was unavoidable.

Now, back in Winnipeg I take up the loose stnngs. l have completed the
form for the Mexico meeting. With luck we will stay on for a few extra
days but the room rates at the Ritz are too Ritzy for my post retirement
budget. We shall look elsewhere. Joyce send warm greetings to you and to
Gail and we look forward with pleasure to seeing you in February.

Sincerely

NM
